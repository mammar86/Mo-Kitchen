## Inspiration for the App

I always have passion about `cooking and implement new food recipes so I
decided to create this app to be able to document and save any new recipe
I make as well as enable others to do the same. I also used a remote API
(Spoonacular) to display other recipes.

The app is still work in progress and there is a lot of future improvments
to be added.

## Features

diet, specific ingredient, cuisine...etc. Also there is the user recipes
page where the users can view recipes added by other members and can added
