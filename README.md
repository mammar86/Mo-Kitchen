## Inspiration for the App

I always have passion about `cooking and implement new food recipes so I
decided to create this app to be able to document and save any new recipe
I make as well as enable others to do the same. I also used a remote API
(Spoonacular) to display other recipes.

The app is still work in progress and there is a lot of future improvments
to be added.

## Features

Through This App, user can view random recipes also can search recipes by
diet, specific ingredient, cuisine...etc. Also there is the user recipes
page where the users can view recipes added by other members and can added
